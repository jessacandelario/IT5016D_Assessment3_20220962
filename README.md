Assessment 3 - Research Repository

by: Jessa Candelario

This research repository is a compilation of all the codes that I have created, or found throughout the course.

Before the start of this course, I have a very little knowledge in software development. With this course, I was able to learn more about it and understand how it works, or at least Python. I cannot say that I am good at it already because I know for myself that I would need a lot more to learn and experience.

In this course, I realized that there are a lot of very interesting things you can actually do. As I progress in the modules and learn more, I sometimes reach some point that I am able to accomplish what the learning activity is asking for, but I wanted it to print differently so I try to search or ask my husband or some friends how I am going to print it the way I want it to. Most of them I get to find the answer, which is good.

Being resourceful is very essential in coding. You have to know how to find what you are looking for, where to find it, or who to ask. It made me realize that curiosity is one of the key quality that I should have in order to improve myself in terms or software development.

In this repository, you will see the codes that I have created. It is organized in folders according to the module number and part. All (or at least most), files are named according to what topic it falls under. As you read through the codes, you will see the comments and notes that I have placed. Most of my codes in here are answers to the learning activities. Some of them have been updated when I run through all of them. I have left some notes on what I have learned and how the code was changed into a more efficient code.
